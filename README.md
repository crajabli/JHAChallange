This is a Job Hazard Analysis application written to accomodate all of the features that were needed

To run the app, the best would be to use a Docker

Run it with the `docker-compose up --build` command

application should be available on the localhost:8080 page.

If you don't have access to a docker initialize venv in the root folder and then cd into the backend folder create venv and
run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and after that run `python run.py`

after that in the seperate terminal cd into the frontend folder and run `npm install` and then `vue sere`

The application should be available on the localhost:8080
